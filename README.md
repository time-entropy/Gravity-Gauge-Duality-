# Gravity-Gauge-Duality

ABSTRACT:  Our previous research (“The Arrow of Time under Time and Entropy Mapping Model”) established a discrete spacetime model mapping multiplicative entropy to time evolution, providing an entropy coordinate for computational physics simulations. This study develops the spacetime quantization framework based on Space Elementary Quanta (SEQ), proposing that gravitational interactions fundamentally arise from translational deformations of the SEQ network. The model reveals that mass originates as stored gravitational potential energy through SU(3)-mediated spatial compression, while gravity emerges as consequential stretching of surrounding SEQ structure - providing a unified mechanism for both inertial and gravitational mass. Building on general relativity's curvature framework but from a discrete spacetime perspective, we demonstrate how equivalent gravitational fields generated by acceleration share this same origin through directional SEQ compression. The theory further offers a concrete physical interpretation of SU(3) color interactions as dynamic spatial compression modes within hadrons, establishing a direct connection between quantum chromodynamics and gravitational phenomena.The Higgs field acts as a quantum chiral lock, stabilizing the SU(3)-mediated elastic energy storage in localized space by enforcing symmetry-breaking constraints. Through this approach, we construct a tentative unification framework where both general relativity's spacetime curvature and quantum field theory's gauge interactions emerge from the underlying dynamics of quantized space.
